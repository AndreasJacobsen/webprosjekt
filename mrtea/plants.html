			<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
	                <p>Let us start like every all night college-level paper in the history of this planet starts, with a citation: 
	                    'Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the tea plant, <i>Camellia sinensis' - Martin, Laura C. (2007). Tea: The Drink that Changed the World. Tuttle Publishing. ISBN 0804837244.</i> </p>

	                <p>  Now we now what tea is but the problem of the all the other people not knowing what tea is still persists, thus this page. 
	                For many the definition of tea is ' Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves or fruits' and they completely forget about or is oblivious to Camellie sinensis even existing. 
	                On this page I wish to clarify what tea is, encourage you to ridicule anyone calling whatever hot soup they are drinking tea and learn the most common ways Camellie sinensis is served. </p>

	                <p> While all real tea is made from the plant Camellie sinensis there are thousands of genetic variations of the plant. 
	                    These variations allow the plant to grow in different climates and altitude, but also changes the taste. 
	                    Tea producers spend allot of time finding the right genetic variation for their tea and also often mix different variations of the plant. 
	                </p> 
	                <h1  id="green"> Green tea </h1> 
	                <p> Green tea is the undergoes very little processing compared to some of the other tea types on the market. 
	                    The leaves of the  Camellie sinensis-plant are quickly steamed after harvest to open the pores in the tea leaves, then dried either by sun, fire or oven.  
	                    After this process it is either sold as leaves, ground or powdered. 
	                    Green tea used to be mainly drunk in Asia but has become widely popular in the west as well, it is also often used as an additive in other consumer goods. 
	                </p>
	              
	                <h1  id="black"> Black tea </h1> 
	                <p> Black tea undergoes more oxidization than green tea (remember the part about the tea leaves being steamed to let air access the tea leaf?), being more oxidized it also has a stronger taste than green tea. 
	                    Many believe black tea came as a result of people over-oxidizing other tea types, and instead of throwing it away tried to drink it. 
	                    Black tea is the most common tea in the west and you'll find it in popular tea's as Earl Grey tea, English breakfast tea and Yellow Label Tea. 
	                    Black tea remains relatively fresh for a long time compared to green, white and oolong tea, making it ideal for long time storage. 
	                    Before the industrial revolution the British drank mainly black tea due to easier shipping and logistics. 
	                    As a general rule the longer the tea has been oxidated, the longer it's shelf life will be. </p>
	
	                <h1  id="white"> White tea </h1> 
	                <p>White tea does not undergo steaming, it is only harvested then dried. 
	                    The more a tea plant has been oxidized the darker the color of the tea, thus is white tea called white tea. 
	                    With as little oxidation as possible during drying and packaging, resulting in a light yellow color on the actual tea.
	                </p>

	                <h1  id="oolong"> Oolong tea </h1> 
	                <p> Oolong tea uses a special type of Camellia sinensis or a blend of special Camellia sinensis-plants Oolong tea is often served as long curly leaves or wrap-curled into small beads. 
	                    Oolong tea is oxidized but the oxidization is aborted just before the tea turns into black tea. 
	                    Apart from the traditional way Oolon gtea looks and is served we can distinct it from the other teas in that it is in the middle of black and green tea. 
	                    Some variations of Oolong is closer to green tea, others are closer to black tea. None of them are either black or green tea. 
	                <p/>
	                <h1  id="blends"> Blends </h1>
	                <p> Tea is created using the  Camellia sinensis plant, but you can mix different variaties of oxidization and other ingredients inn. 
	                    As long as it contains the plant you can call mango tea for mango tea (dried mango and Camellie sinesis). 
	                    Just dried mango and water is mango soup. Today we have a huge variaty of  teas blended with other ingredients to create different flavors.
	                </p> 
	                <h1  id="soups" > The soups </h1>
	                <p>  Some people call it herbal tea, fruit tea, bush tea or other things. 
	                    I call it soup. Many dried fruits and plants are often mistaken for tea, examples include dried Rooibos, peppermint leaves, hibiscus and comfrey.  
	                    By all means, if you like these soups keep drinking them, but please don't call them tea's, yell at shops marketing them as tea and ridicule then alienate any one thinking they drink tea when it actually is soup. 
	                </p>
	                <br/> That was all for today, Mr. Tea out.
