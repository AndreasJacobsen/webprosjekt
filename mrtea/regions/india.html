				<h2 id="history-chn">History:</h2>

				<p>China has had a relationship to tea for millennia.</p>

				<p>In the Chinese tradition, the discovery of tea is credited to the deity/emperor/father-of-Chinese-agriculture Shennong (his name translates to ‘Divine Farmer’).</p>

				<p>Shennong has an impressive list of innovations to his name; including: the hoe, the plow, the Axe, digging wells, agricultural irrigation, preserving stored seeds in horse-urine, weekly farmers markets, the Chinese calendar. Also, his body was translucent, so he was an ideal test subject for experimental herbs and spices.
				By most accounts Shennong was awesome, and super cool to the agricultural folk of ancient China.</p>

				<p>Legend has it that on one autumn-day, in 2737BCE, Shennong took a rest from being awesome by a Camellia tree.
				He boiled water in a pot, as he, like most contemporary Chinese, favored boiling water over cold water,
				in terms of having a drink.
				By chance, leaves from the Camellia tree fell into the pot, thus creating Chinese folk-lore’s first pot of tea (as illustrated above the table of contents).</p>

				<p>If you prefer less fanciful background info,
				then I would also mention that written sources speak of putting leaves (possibly tea leaves) in water during the Zhao dynasty period (1046 - 256 BCE).
				The Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE) was known to have used tea for medicinal purposes,
				and the Tang Dynasty writer, Lu Yu (729-804 CE), records that the drinking of tea was widespread around 760 CE.</p>

				</p>Whether you accept the awesomeness of Shennong or the more sporadic mentions of tea throughout Chinese history, it is safe to say that the Chinese were drinking tea before it was cool!</p>

				<h2 id="types-chn">Types of tea:</h2>

				<h3 id="Oolong">Oolong</h3>
				<p>Oolong is made out of Camellia. That’s right,
				that same plant that our ‘divine farmer'-friend stumbled across way-back-when.
				Oh, and Oolong means Black Dragon, bah-chow!</p>

				<p>Oolong is semi-fermented, somewhere between unfermented green tea and fermented black tea.<br />
				The level of fermentation varies from 8% to 70%.<br />
				I am sure all this means it tastes great!<br />
				Oolong is produced mainly in the Chinese regions of Fujian, Guangdong and Taiwan,
				but other countries also have variants.</p>

				<p>A survival tip for Japan is that ordering Oolong in a bar or
				Karaoke place will probably get you a glass of cool Oolong, possibly with alcohol in it.</p>

				<h3 id="White-tea">White tea</h3>

				<p>White tea is also made from Camellia, how about that!?<br />
				Seems most Chinese teas are!
				This tea is lightly fermented, can control insulin secretion, can reduce radiation levels and repair DNA damage and 					I would not be surprised if it could make you breakfast!<br />
				Growing regions in China include Fujian and Jejien.</p>

				<p>Mr. Tea is currently researching white tea’s efficiency in tackling blue-tooth-related hypochondria.</p>

				<h3 id="Pu-erh-tea">Pu-erh-tea</h3>

				<p>Pu-erh-tea is similar to wine, in the sense that it must age at least 3 months,
				post-production, before it is deemed drinkable. The unique Pu-erh taste starts to develop after about 5 years.
				It should be stored somewhere cool and dry, not prone to constant temperature fluctuations.
				Kitchens are not suitable storage places, as tea tends to soak up odors, thus influencing the taste.</p>

				<p>You can find both green and black variants. Mr. Tea likes them all!</p>

        <h2 id="consumption-ind">Consumption of tea in India </h2>
        <br/>
          <p>
            India is the second largest producer of tea in the world after China, including the famous Assam tea and Darjeeling tea.
            According to the ASSOCHAM report released in December, 2011, India was the world’s largest consumer of tea.
            There consumption was around 30 percent of the global usage of tea.
            India is also the second largest producer of tea.
            Despite the production, India is also one of the largest exporter of tea after China.
          </p>

        <h2 id="background-ind">Background </h2>
          <br/>
          <p>
            The culture and brewing of tea in India has a long history of traditional systems of medicine and for consumption.
            The practice of Ayurveda has resulted in a long standing tradition of herbal teas.
            Traditional Indian kitchens have long utilised the medicinal benefits offered by various plants and spices such as
            basil, cardamom, pepper, liquorice, mint, and other spices, and traditionally, teas made with these plant leaves and/or spices has been used for centuries.
          </p>

        <h2 id="noticed-ind">First noticed </h2>
          <br/>
          <p>
            The consumption of tea in India was first seen in the Ramayana (750-500 BC). For the next thousand years, documentation of tea in India was lost in history.
            Records re-emerge during the first century AD, with stories of the Buddhist monks Bodhidharma and Gan Lu, and their involvement with tea.
            Research shows that tea is indigenous to eastern and northern India, and was cultivated and consumed there for thousands of years.
            Commercial production of tea in India did not begin until the arrival of the British East India Company, at that time large tracts of land were converted for mass tea production.
          </p>

        <h2 id="introduction-ind">Introduction </h2>
          <br/>
          <p>
            There are many popular variations of tea in India depending on regional and cultural affiliations.
            Tea drinkers in India drink milk tea.
            There are many other popular variations depending on regional and cultures.
            Popular tea brews in Assam are saah, ronga saah (red tea without milk).
            In West Bengal and Bangladesh it is called Cha. In Hindi speaking countries, popular tea brews are Masala Chai, Kadak Chai, typically a feature of the mountain community of North India, this is a very strongly brewed tea, almost to the point of bitterness.
            India was the top producer of tea for nearly a century, but recently China has overtaken India as the top tea producer due to increased land availability.
            Indian tea companies have acquired a number of iconic foreign tea enterprises including British brands Tetley and Typhoo.
            India is also the world's largest tea-drinking nation. However, the per capita consumption of tea in India remains a modest 750 grams per person every year due to the large population base and high poverty levels.
