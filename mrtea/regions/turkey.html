				<h2 id="introduction-turk">Introduction </h2>

				<p>
	Turkish tea also called çay is a black tea witch is consumed without milk.
	This tea is produced in the eastern Black Sea coast, witch has a mild climate and a lot of rain, their soil is also very fertile. <br/>
	Turkish tea is typically prepared using two stacked kettles (çaydanlık) specially designed for tea preparation.
	Water is brought to a boil in the larger lower kettle and then some of the water is used to fill the smaller kettle on top and steep (brew) several spoons of loose tea leaves, producing a very strong tea.
	When the tea is served, the exess water in the lower kettle is used to dilute the tea so the consumer has the choice of consuming the tea strong or light, where the water comes in hand.<br/>
	The excess water is used to make the tea strong witch is the dark tea, or light tea who is the lighter one.
	To finish up the tradisional Turkish tea you drink the tea in a small glass to enjoy it hot and in addition to showing its color. At last you have you add your sugar beet cubes.
	</p>

				<h2 id="background-turk">Background </h2>

				<p>
	Tea is an important part of Turkish culture, and is the most commonly consumed hot drink, despite the country's long history of coffee consumption.
	Offering tea to guests is part of Turkish hospitality.<br/>
	Tea is most often consumed in households, shops and mostly kıraathane, which is social congregation of Turkish men.
	Despite its popularity, tea is the widely consumed beverage of choice in Turkey only in the 20th century.
	It was an alternative to coffee, which had become expensive and at times unavailable after the World war I.<br/>
	After the loss of southeastern territories and the fall of the Ottaman Empire, coffee became an expensive import.
	Turkish tea is traditionally offered in small tulip-shaped glasses which are usually held by the rim of the glass, in order to save the drinker's fingertips from being burned, as the tea is served boiling hot.
	Brewed for a long time for at  least 15 minutes, this tea is then mixed with hot water and sweetened with sugar to taste.
	As in other Muslim countries, tea (and to some extent still coffee) takes the place of alcohol as the social beverages.
	Turkish tea became popular everywhere, drunk at any time.
	</p>


				<h2 id="history-turk">History </h2>

				<p>
	The first plantations were started in 1924 in Rize, with tea seeds brought from the neighbor country Georgia.
	Rize tea or çay is the black tea which is mentioned earlier in this text.
	Rize tea or Çay is a form of black tea and produces a crystal clear liquid that is mahogany in color.
	The tea is produced without additives or chemicals during either the growing or processing stages. 
	After picking, the tea leaves are withered for a time to reduce their water content and then rolled by machine to facilitate the oxidation process essential to the fermentation that produces black tea.

				<h2 id="herbal-turk">Turkish herbal teas </h2>

				<p>
	  In Turkey, herbal teas are not looked oppon as real teas or true teas.
	  They are instead used as herbal medication. They are mostly popular with tourists.
	  Sage tea (ada çayı, literally meaning "island tea") is most popular in the Mediterranean coastal region.
	  In Turkey, herbal teas for most ailments can be found in local herbal shops.
	  Dried herbal leaves, petals, shoots, etc. are sold in loose-leaf according to each customer's need and taste.
