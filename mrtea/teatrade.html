				<p>The story of the first cup of tea might sound like a fairytale. At least it does for Mr. Tea. Whether you want to believe it or not the story goes as follows.</p> 
				<p>The Chinese emperor Shennong once sat in his gardens with a cup of boiling water.<br /> 
				Shennong thought that boiling water would be healthier for the body you see. <br /> 
				He saw a leaf from one of his plants in his garden fall down into the cup.<br /> 
				He didn’t bother to remove it and was surprised by the taste of this new drink.</p> 
			
				<p>Whether or not you want to believe this, he has been renowned as the inventor of tea all the way back to the Han dynasty, 
				where he was pictured plowing a field of tea plants in a painting.</p>
			
				<p>Other believes that it was the monk Buddha that first discovered the tea plant by just chewing at one of its leaves.</p>
				<p>Shennong lived around year 2737 BC, and since his discovery the drink has been used by monks all over china to help focus on their meditating. One cup of tea contains half the amount of caffeine or teein as it’s called when it is in tea.</p> 
				<p>Teein is taken up slower into the body and therefore lasts longer and not as rapid as caffeine.<br /> 
				This is why the monks preferred drinking tea over coffee.</p> 
			
				<p>It was not until the 9th century that a Chinese monk revealed their secret drink when he was traveling to japan.<br /> It was here the tradition of Chado, the art of preparing and drinking tea, was developed by Japanese monks.</p>
			
				<p>Several hundred years later, the tyranny of imperialism has risen, and importing of exotic products exploded.</p>
				 
				<p>The Portuguese and Dutch where the first to import tea from china during the 17th century.<br /> 
				The drink became popular, but none place as much as in the upper-class of England.</p>
			
				<p>Tea was taxed as much as 119% which led to a big black market of the herb.<br />
				One hundred years later over half of all tea in England came from the black market.<br /> 
				The taxes were removed in 1784, 11 years after the famous Boston Tea Party which preceded the Declaration of Independence that launched the USA's war of independence.</p>
 
				<p>The aftermath of the Boston tea party led to a change in social and political view upon tea.<br /> 
				Tea was very popular before this but became frowned upon by the people because it represented the very foundation of British imperialism. 
			
				<p>As the British East Indian Trading Company came to arise, tea stood for over one third of their profits.</p> 
			
				<p>In the 1900th century tea was the third largest export material only below iron and cotton.</p>
			
				<p>One may think that the opium wars in the 19th century was about opium, when in fact the opium wars was about tea.<br /> 
				The Chinese would only accept silver as currency for tea which led the British to find new ways to get their hands into more silver.</p> 
				<p>India was still a colony under Brittan and it was from there that the brits exported and sold opium to Chinese traders. Opium became very popular in China but did'nt catch on in Europe.<br />
				This created a more balanced trade for the Brits even though a few years later it would all be for nothing.</p>
			
				<p>In 1820 the Brits found a type of tea growing wild in the Assam region of India.<br /> 
				This the closest region bordering China.</p>
				  
				<p>This meant that the Chinese monopoly of tea was over.
			
				<p>The British spread the tea plant to most parts of India and even Sri Lanka for cultivation. 
				This also led to infrastructures being created for transportation of tea from the plantations all the way down south to the transport ships.<br /> 
				This was a good thing for India back then and still serves them to this very day.</p>
			
				<p>On the other hand, the way of working at these tea plantations where adopted from the former slave ways in middle and South America.</p>
				<p>As early as in 1888 the British colony of India surpassed the Chinese in feeding the demand of tea in Europe. 
				The way of cultivating tea in India was implanted in other colonies such as Kenya and Salon.</p>

		<h2> What to be aware of</h2>

		<p>Today there is alot of ways to make your tea experience an ethical one. You can always look for certification which is distinct for each of the biggest tea growing countries. a good example is the Ceylon Tea symbol of quality.</p>
		<p>Other things you can look for is if the is marked eco friendly or not and if the tea is fair trade approved. 
	
		<p>There is also a company called the Ethical Tea Partnership. This is a non profit company which has strict policies of monitoring and certification.</p>
	
		<p>Tea, as read above, has a troubled history, and we should then keep a good eye on whether your tea is up to date on todays political and ethical standards</p>
